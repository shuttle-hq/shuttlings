# Shuttlings

This is [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/)'s collection of code challenges for learning web backend development with Rust. The name is derived from [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), which is also a great resource for learning Rust basics.

## Why did we create this repo?

After the success of our Christmas Code Hunt in December 2023, we realized the positive impact that practical coding challenges could have on learning Rust. This repo was created to continue that momentum, offering a collection of real-world problems for developers to solve and learn from all year round. It serves as a permanent, go-to resource for honing web backend skills through hands-on practice with Rust.

We've seen the challenges being copied and used in numerous cases, such as educating team members at companies or educating students at an university. Now, we are making them available to everyone and we'll be focusing over time on continuously refining and expanding this collection to offer challenges that cater to all skill levels, supporting the growth of Rust developers on their learning journey.
