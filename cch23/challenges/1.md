# 🎄 Day 1: Packet "exclusive-cube" not found

*In the frosty expanses of the North Pole, Santa's advanced packet management system has encountered a glitch. This system, known for its robustness and magical speed, is responsible for sorting and dispatching all the Christmas gifts. However, a sudden aurora borealis storm has scattered bits of data across the snowy landscape, leaving Santa in dire need of a digital handyman to restore order.*

## ⭐ Task 1: Cube the bits

Santa needs your programming expertise to recalibrate the packet IDs in his packet management system.

Implement a GET endpoint `/1/<num1>/<num2>` that takes 2 integers in the path, `num1` and `num2`, and returns the result of `(num1 XOR num2) POW 3`, where *XOR* is the exclusive OR operation, and *POW* is exponentiation.

### 🔔 Tips

Check your web framework's docs for clues how to match the URI path pattern:

- [Axum Routing](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/#routing)
- [Axum Extractors](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/extract/index.html)
- [Actix Web Extractors](https://actix.rs/docs/extractors)
- [Rocket Dynamic Paths](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/requests/#dynamic-paths)

### 💠 Example

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/1/4/8

1728
```

## 🎁 Task 2: The sled ID system (100 bonus points)

After the packet IDs are calibrated and the packets are packed into sleds,
Santa needs to calibrate the sled ID.

The formula is very similar: All packet IDs (integers) are *XOR*'ed with each other, and then the result is (again) raised to the power of 3. The catch is that there can be between 1 and 20 packets in a sled!

Adapt the endpoint from Task 1 so that it can also be used to calculate sled IDs.

### 💠 Examples

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/1/10

1000
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/1/4/5/8/10

27
```
